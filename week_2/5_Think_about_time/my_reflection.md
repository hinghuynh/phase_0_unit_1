# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
Doing work throughout the week rather than forcing all of it at the end of the week, as well as efficiently using my time, insteaad of getting distracting or stop because I am not in the mood or I feel like my brain isn't up for the task.
* How will you combat that? 
I found that i usually don't know how much work I have until I've gone through the material in the weekend. In the coming weeks I will go through all the material briefly and give myself a rough outline of kind of a to do list. Then slowly go through all tasks in the timely fashion.
* What techniques will you try?
I've used the Pomodoro Technique in the past, and have found it effective. So I will start using this technique again.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My overall plan is consistently chipping away on these projects one step at a time, knowing that every little thing that I learn or create, might not amount to anything now, but I know that everyone who's ever created something amazing as gone through a similar process. It is only but slowly building the foundation one piece at a time that one day I'll have created something great.
