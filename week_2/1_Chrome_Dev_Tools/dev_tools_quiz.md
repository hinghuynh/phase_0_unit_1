##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
*  **Realtime editing of HTML and CSS**

    *HTML can be edited in elements tab. As for CSS you can work within the styles tab of the element tab or work in the source tab. These can be done just by simply clicking on the desire text you want to edit and change it. or click on the checkbox of the styles tab if you want to remove or add back certain css features.*
*  **Javascript Debugging**
  
     *Javascript can be debugged in console. Typing console commands to find the problem and usually editted will take place in the elements or source tab.*
*  **Performance Optimization**
  
     *For performance optimization you should use the network tab, to figure out what is slowing down your site loading. It provides details like file size and loading time, which can be used to figure out what files are too big or what is taking too long to load, so you can figure out what to work with to increase efficiency.*

* **What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?**

      *For windows it's F12 or shift+ctrl+i*


* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * **What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)**
   
      *It's (#0b0f11) which is a intermediate blue-green.
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

**MY IMAGE** http://tinypic.com/r/105yyrl/8

* **For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.**

*Because the entire thing is an image, and you cannot edit text on an image without using some kind of photo editor.*
* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * **What is the largest image on the website?**
  
*I believe it is a nighttime picture of new york times square. 316kb*
 
  * **Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.**
*You could look at the network tab in dev tools and then organize files by content size and look for the biggest picture. url: http://www.ticketswizard.com/Images/Catalog/92624182-c482-4a35-8da2-4fbf2f502e94_Large_Large.png 500px x 210px
* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
