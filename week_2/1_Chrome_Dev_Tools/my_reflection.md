# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

**Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?**

DOM is a platform that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update structure, content, and style of documents. I understand that by combining HTML and CSS script, you have kind of DOM. Is DOM like a model in which i view the way my code is organized through the seperation of HTML and CSS? I really like keeping the aesthetics and content of a webpage seperate, it feels more organized. I don't like that I have to work on two seperate files.

**How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?**

Wordpress sites just looked more organizd when looking at the files in the element and source tabs. There seem to be alot of classes and ids use.

**Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?**

I like Chrome Web Tools. I think it's a great way to be able to decipher and breakout how a site operates or optimize your own site. Makes it easier to navigate specific things in a website for quick changes.  

**Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?**

nope

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

nope
