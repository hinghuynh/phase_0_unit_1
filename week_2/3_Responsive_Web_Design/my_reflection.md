# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* **What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?**

Responsive web design is site view optimization for various screensizes using the use of fluid grids and media queries. Fluid grids allow you to divide your site sections by ratios instead of set pixels. Media queries are used to create sites optimized for screensizes where your pre-set ratios don't make sense, and in those cases you might want to create omit or reconfigure the way the site will look.  I think it's brilliant and it's good practice, because I believe that as tech industry continues to evolve, we are going to have an ever-increasing variation in screensizes.
* **How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?**

I think smartphones and tablets have basically forced web designers to adapt to every changing variations in screen resolutions and sizes.  I think as the variation increases, anyone who isn't using responsive web design will be force to switch.
* **How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?**

Visually impaired people use aids like text-to-speech software to extract information from the web. We should definitely design and develop for them.
* **What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?**

Responsive Web Design really resonated with me. When i made my earlier projects, I used set pixels to create the sizing of my page optimized for my own viewing, and did not think about how it would look of smaller resolution screens. 
* **Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

nope
