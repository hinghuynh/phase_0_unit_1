# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* **What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?**

I feel web standards are very necessary in creating some commonalities. It allows for basic foundation on which to work with, and allows for easier comprehension when read by others.
* **Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?**

I think the standard structure makes for more eloquent formatting, but it's going to take a while for me to adjust. I am not familiar with all the new syntax in HTML5, but seem like nice improvements to the existing syntax.
* **Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?**

I love the new elements. On my first few projects, I had what girldevelopit called div-itis. I like that there's less to type and it's much simplier to read.
* **Why is reset.css necessary?**

Reset.css is necessary, because it allows most browser-compatiblity, so you don't have to keep up to date with hundreds of browsers.
* **What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?**

I have used IE, Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari.  Yes I've noticed sometimes sites aren't optimized or even working in specific browsers. Also the layout engine for browsers which interprets the CSS is different for every browsers. I think it's good, because people have different taste and preferences. Different browsers will give different people different viewing experiences.
