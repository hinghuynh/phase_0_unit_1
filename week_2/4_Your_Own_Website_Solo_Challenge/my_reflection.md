# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://hinghuynh.github.io/

Discuss the following:
**What did you learn about design and user experience?**

I learned it's not very easy. For me the design seems much more difficult than implementation.
**Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)**

I hated it  I was stuck on the plan and the wireframe for a really long time. I needed more contraints to work with. I don't work well with complete freedom.
**What was your process? What worked and didn't work?**

I just pick a few things I liked from other sites and tried to incorporate them into mine.
**What would you like to add or change about the site next?**

I want to spend some more time redoing the index, but i need to spend more time learning first, before another run at it.
**Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?**

It wasn't too difficult to apply things I learned. I didn't find anything super cool yet.
**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
nope.
